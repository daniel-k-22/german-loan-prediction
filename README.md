# german-loan-prediction

The data set contains historical data of the customers who have taken loans from a German bank and the bank is facing issues with loan defaulters. The bank intends to build a machine learning model to predict whether the customer will default or not based on historical data

Please go through the `German_Bank_Loan_Default_Prediction.ipynb` files to see the the analysis, models. 
Please go through the `Daniel_Raj_Report.pdf` for the results and findings.

# Conclusion

Finally, after performing different kinds of analysis different insights are generated. Based on these insights suggested by the model the bank can be cautious while providing loan to the customer, and can use the developed gradient boosting model on the current customers to predict whether the customer will default and accordingly take necessary actions such as sending notifications to clear the loan amount as soon as possible. But in order to improve the performance of the model continuous data collection should be performed and the model has to be trained on a frequent basis so that the bank does not face any new challenges when the data get changed in the future.
